Server Front End

This is the Front End of the Server Management App.  It was created using angular.  This repository allows the user to interact with the Back End of the Server Management app by interacting through API calls.


Back End Link: https://github.com/DrewWalt/Server-Back-End.git

To run you must have the Angluar CLI installed.  Once installed type 'ng serve' in the file directory while the backend is running and it should run on http://localhost:4200/.
